# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Pewlet Hackard's HR analyst, Bobby, has been tasked by his manager with determining the number of retiring employees per title as well as identifying those employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. I have assisted Bobby with this assessment in order to preppare Bobby's manger for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees are reaching retirement age.

## Results

### Retiring Employees by Title
  * There are 90,398 employees who are eligible for retirement which is ~ 30% of the 300,024 total employees.
  * The majority of the employees eligible for retirement is between two job titles:
    * Senior Engineers have 29,914 eligible retirees, which is ~ 33% of those employees eligible for retirement and ~ 10% of the total employees.
    * Senior Staff employees eligible for retirement amount to 28,254, which is ~31% of employees eligible for retirement and ~9% of the total employees.
    * Combined these two total senior level employees amount to ~64% of those employees eligible for retirement and ~19% of the total employees.
  * Luckily only 2 managers are eligible for retirement which is a relief after the high amount of senior level employees that will be departing.
  * Below are two tables created to find this data
    * The unique titles table:

### Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
  * There are a total of 1,549 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. This amounts to a very low ~0.02% of the retirement-ready employees.
  * These employees were born in 1965 which puts them at an age of ~56 years old. 
  * These employees joined Pewlett Hackard between a 17 year range of 1985 and 2002.
  * Below is a small portion of a table created to determine those employees who are eligible for the mentorship program:

### Summary
* There will be 90,398 job roles to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make a big impact.
* There are only 1,594 qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. This means that each qualified employee for the mentorship program would have to mentor ~57 new employees. This seems very unlikely which leads to the conclusion that Pewlett Hackard does not have enough qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of employees.
